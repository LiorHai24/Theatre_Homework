# Popcorn Palace - Movie Theater Booking System

## Overview
Popcorn Palace is a movie theater booking system that allows users to manage movies, showtimes, and bookings. The system supports creating and managing movies, theaters, showtimes, and handling bookings with seat validation. The system ensures that showtime durations match their corresponding movie durations and handles theater capacity management.

I took it to my own personal direction with adding a theater as an object(you can see the api in this file for creation and view of the existing theaters)with number of rows, seats per row, and total capacity, getting a unique id upon creation.
I believed it would be more realistic to have objects in the code, also implemented movies and showtime, so for a showtime object you can see all the neccessary details.
Moreover, for updating and deletion, in addition to the status code 200 of success, there is also a matching message.

   - A 5-minute tolerance is allowed for small discrepancies
   - If the duration doesn't match, a BadRequestException is thrown

2. Theater Capacity:
   - Theater capacity is automatically calculated as rows * seatsPerRow
   - Showtimes cannot be created if the theater has no available seats
   - Available seats are tracked per showtime

3. Theater Names:
   - Theater names must be unique
   - Theater names are used as primary keys
   - Theater names are case-sensitive

4. Showtime Overlap:
   - No overlapping showtimes are allowed in the same theater
   - A BadRequestException is thrown if there's an overlap

5. Seat Validation:
   - Seat numbers must be valid for the theater's capacity
   - No duplicate bookings for the same seat in a showtime
   - Available seats count is updated when bookings are made
